# RiotJS Pantry App
Creating my pantry app in RiotJS

## Concepts Learned
* Proper JSON syntax. Found a [good set of examples](https://adobe.github.io/Spry/samples/data_region/JSONDataSetSample.html).
* **A**rrays use **B**rackets [ ]. Remember A/B.
* **O**bjects use **C**urly braces { }. Remember O/C.
* Look at the "vue" project to see how they're linking page views together instead of having more standard routing.
* How to make an javascript AJAX call **without jQuery**
* How to create event methods and connect them to our UI
